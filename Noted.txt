In tF , tfFiles are always execute in alphbatical order.
abc.tf,def.tf,geh.tf ... -> suppose this type of file names we have then files also exe in alphabatical order.

For type var value in string -> "Hello ${var.varname}"

give var value through cmdline -> terraform plan -var "username=MrunalMania"

also inside a single tf file , all blocks run as per alphbatical order.

=====================================================================================

terraform.tfvars => terraform read value of defined variables from this file.

cusotm terraform tfvars file -> development.tfvars -> run cmd -> terraform plan -var-file=filename  / in our case -> terraform plan -var-file=development.tfvars

===================
environment variable=> export username = mrunal

if we want to read environment variable value to our tf file->
export TF_VAR_variblename = variable value.
e.g -> export TF_VAR_username = mrunal
